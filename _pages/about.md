I'm a third-year PhD student from [Dyson School of Design Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). My research interest includes robotics, robot manipulation, machine learning, and computer vision.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Dr Nicolas Rojas of REDS Lab.
