I'm a third-year PhD student from [Dyson School of Design Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/design-engineering/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). My research interests include robotics, robot manipulation, perception for grasping and manipulation, and learning-based control. Specifically, I am focusing on developing and applying advanced methods for solving **real-world** robot manipulation problems with **data-efficient** approaches.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Dr Petar Kormushev of [Robot Intelligence Lab]([https://www.imperial.ac.uk/reds-lab/](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/robot-intelligence/)), Dr Nicolas Rojas of [REDS Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/reds-lab/). Before joining Imperial College, I received an M.S. degree in Robotics at King's College London, London, UK, in 2020, and a B.Eng. degree in Mechanical Design, Manufacturing and Automation at Taiyuan University of Technology(太原理工大学), Taiyuan, China, in 2019.
